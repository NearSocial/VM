# VM Analytics Manifesto

## Ethos
We aim to build an engaging two-way marketplace of open web applications for developers and users. To iterate on UX experiments as we work towards this goal, we need to understand the behavior of user cohorts and the UX pathways they most and least engage with. User information is protected by not recording PII such as wallet or IP addresses.

## Long Term
The current implementation is a temporary solution. Our long-term goal is to implement a more sustainable, non-centralized product analytics solution. This is going to be on the roadmap for Q3 and Q4 of 2023. 

## Privacy
- Wallet addresses are not recorded
- User activity is anonymized and analyzed in aggregate

## Opt Out
- Any gateway which uses the Near Discovery VM can opt-out of sharing usage information by forking and removing `data/analytics.js`

## Product Usage Events Recorded
- Component Impressions
- Component Engagements
